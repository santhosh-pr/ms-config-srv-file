# ms-config-srv-file
Spring cloud config server from local file system

As we are storing the configuration or data file in local file system[doesnâ€™t use Git], we should enable the profile - **native**

I kept the configuration files to be loaded under the *src/test/resources/config* folder. 

We can specify the path of directory in application.yml file *search-location property*. 

The configuration file [data file] name should be match with application.name in the application.yml file

*we can rename the application.yml by setting the value for spring.config.name as jvm arg*


we can see the results by invoking the endpoints

http://localhost:7000/ms-config-srv/default 


http://localhost:7000/ms-config-srv/dev
